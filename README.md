JavaScript Memory Card Game

This is a game I recently decided to make because I thought it would be a fun little challenge. 

It is still a Work In Progress, the code in this game is definitely not desirable but I have not mastered the advanced concepts in JS yet
so I will have to come back and refine/refacter the code

To Do's:

* re-code
* Improved CSS/Design
* A Score Board/ Tally of points(times you guessed the right card)
* A difficulty setting/button that will change the amount of time to see where the cards are placed
* Make Responsive
