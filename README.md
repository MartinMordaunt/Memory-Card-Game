JavaScript Memory Card Game

This is a game I recently decided to make because I thought it would be a fun little challenge. 

It is still a Work In Progress.

To Do's:

* A Pop-up Modal for game completion 
* Fix scoring so that cards already matched cannot be clicked again for extra points
* Improved CSS/Design
* A difficulty setting/button that will change the amount of time to see where the cards are placed
* Restart Button
* Make Responsive
