JavaScript Memory Card Game

This is a game I recently decided to make because I thought it would be a fun little challenge. 

It is still a Work In Progress. Things I plan to add:

* Improved CSS/Design
* A Score Board/ Tally of points(times you guessed the right card)
* A difficulty setting/button that will change the amount of time to see where the cards are placed
